# WitcherBook
Parser for collecting data about "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" (and DLCs) monsters from Witcher Wiki (Russian)
This is my Python mini-project for practicing Python itself and web-scraping using BeautifulSoup and requests modules.
# Idea
I enjoy playing "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt", this is one of my favourite games.
Recently I started to learn Python and understood that best way to ptactice programming language is to apply it in real project.
So I came up with the idea that your hobbies and your study projects have to be united in order to learn quicker and to enjoy your studying.
