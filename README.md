# WitcherBook
Parser for collecting data about "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" (and DLCs) monsters from Witcher Wiki (Russian)  
This is my Python mini-project for practicing Python itself and web-scraping using BeautifulSoup and requests modules.
# Idea
I enjoy playing "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt", this is one of my favourite games.
Recently I started to learn Python and understood that best way to ptactice programming language is to apply it in real project.
So I came up with the idea that your hobbies and your study projects have to be united in order to learn quicker and to enjoy your studying.
# Files in this repo
You can see 4 files here excepting README:  
*main.py* - basically main python file with all the code to parse data about monsters  
*gitignore* - my gitignore project file that contains all the python cache, DS_Store files and file named *config.py*. My User Agent and Accept are stored in this file (you know, it's not good to show them to everyone). I import them to *main.py*  
*WitcherBook.csv* - this is the result of my code execution   
*WitcherBook.xlsx* - this is the very same, but Microsoft Excel book
